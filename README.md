Rust-Pixelflut
==============

A [Pixelflut](https://cccgoe.de/wiki/Pixelflut) client written in [rust](https://rust-lang.org), mostly as a starting point to get familiar with the language.

In this repository you can find the first program have ever written in rust ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ‰ (apart from calculating prime numbers and hello world).

This is one of the fun things I got to do at [GPN17](https://entropia.de/GPN17).

Enhanced on [GPN19](https://entropia.de/GPN19):
* Config file
* Better error handling on the TCP connections
* Support for sending images
* Closing connections on Ctrl-C
